I work at [PebblePad](https://pebblepad.com/) as a Senior Software Developer and Apprenticeship Manager.

Half of my work is actively working with teams of apprentice software developers helping them work through their sprints as a senior developer and Scrum Master and breaking down any and all impediments.Â The other half of my work is designing and facilitating the PebblePad Academy, it's bootcamp for apprentices, and the degree apprenticeship.Â 

When I can I also work on new schemes/techniques for onboarding and/or helping apprentices and our greater team to make sense of tackling learning in the workplace. I love to talk to people about achieving their goals and growing as a developer. ðŸ™‚

LinqEm is a web app for everyone who has that list of useful links for a topic in their favorites, painstakingly aggregated over months if not years of research and/or perusing the web, or that random, publicly shared Microsoft Word document containing a culmination of Movie recommendations, or even that GitHub repo' dedicated to the community's culmination of programming resources and information.

LinqEm is a simple solution and perfect home for all such link collections, beautifully presented in a modern and clean professional format. Drop the tens of â€˜maybe tabsâ€™ clicked open from that Google search and discover a pre-made, hand-crafted and community hardened collection of links for your topic.

We want to create the worldâ€™s universal, community driven, one-stop-shop for aggregating, sharing, and discovering web content for any topic.

**LinqEm's goal is for *every search starts with a community-driven collection of web content*.**
